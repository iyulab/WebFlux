# Simple Test Document

This is a simple markdown document for testing basic parsing functionality.

## Section 1

Here's some **bold text** and *italic text*.

### Subsection 1.1

A paragraph with a [link to example](https://example.com).

## Section 2

Another section with a code block:

```csharp
var greeting = "Hello, World!";
Console.WriteLine(greeting);
```

### Subsection 2.1

A list of items:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And a table:

| Name | Age | City |
|------|-----|------|
| John | 25  | NYC  |
| Jane | 30  | LA   |

That's all for this simple test document.

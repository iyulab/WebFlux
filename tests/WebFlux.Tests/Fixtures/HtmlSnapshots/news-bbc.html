            <p>World leaders from over 190 countries have reached a landmark agreement at the Global Climate Summit, pledging to reduce carbon emissions by 50% before 2035. The agreement, which took two weeks of intense negotiations, has been hailed as a turning point in the fight against climate change.</p>

            <h2>Key Points of the Agreement</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2035</li>
                <li>$100 billion annual fund for developing nations</li>
                <li>Phase-out of coal power by 2030 in developed countries</li>
                <li>Mandatory carbon reporting for large corporations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The agreement represents a significant step forward from previous commitments. Dr. Sarah Chen, lead climate scientist at the International Environmental Agency, described it as "the most ambitious climate accord in history."</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"This agreement shows that when nations come together with political will, meaningful change is possible. The science demanded urgent action, and today we have answered that call."</p>
                <cite>— UN Secretary General</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Implementation Timeline</h2>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Phase</th>
                        <th>Target</th>
                        <th>Deadline</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Phase 1</td>
                        <td>National action plans submitted</td>
                        <td>2025</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Phase 2</td>
                        <td>25% emission reduction</td>
                        <td>2030</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Phase 3</td>
                        <td>50% emission reduction</td>
                        <td>2035</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>However, critics argue that the agreement lacks enforcement mechanisms. Environmental activist group GreenFuture stated that "promises without penalties are just words," calling for binding legal obligations.</p>

            <h2>Economic Impact</h2>

            <p>Economists estimate the transition will require approximately $4.5 trillion in global investment over the next decade. However, the long-term economic benefits of avoiding catastrophic climate change are projected to far outweigh these costs.</p>

            <p>The agreement also includes provisions for a "just transition" fund to support workers in fossil fuel industries who may be displaced by the shift to renewable energy.</p>
